# hyperskill-to-do-list
### My To-Do List project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course.

**Project Number:** #10

**Covered Topics from the Course:** #68

**About:** This To-Do List program helps to manage user's tasks. All the tasks are stored in the SQLite database using SQLAlchemy. The user can view today's tasks, week's tasks (all tasks for 7 days from today), all existing tasks on the database (sorted by deadline), or missed tasks (tasks whose deadline date is earlier than today's date). The program allows the user to add a task by specifying not only the task itself but also the deadline of it. Furthermore, the user can choose to delete any task from the database they have already finished. The program is active all the time unless the user enters 0 to exit.

**Learning Outcomes:** Along with doing the project itself and finding solutions to numerous problems, I was learning more about Python syntax and became more confident in working dictionaries and default arguments. I gained knowledge about inheritance, Object-Relational Mapping and kwargs (multiple keyword arguments) in Python. I have also practiced altering the table in SQL, and learnt more about consistency constraints. Furthermore, I learnt how to utilize the basics of SQLAlchemy to create a SQLite database and work with it in Python programs. This project also allowed me to practice using the datetime module in Python.
