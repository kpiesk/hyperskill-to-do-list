# hyperskill-to-do-list
### My To-Do List project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course.

**Project Number:** #10

**Covered Topics from the Course:** #68

**About:** This To-Do List program helps to manage user's tasks. All the tasks are stored in the SQLite database using SQLAlchemy. The user can view today's tasks, week's tasks (all tasks for 7 days from today), all existing tasks on the database (sorted by deadline), or missed tasks (tasks whose deadline date is earlier than today's date). The program allows the user to add a task by specifying not only the task itself but also the deadline of it. Furthermore, the user can choose to delete any task from the database they have already finished. The program is active all the time unless the user enters 0 to exit.
